# 2015 SAAS Robotics summer camp

## Welcome!

You made it to camp! This is your very own space to write your code and share it with other people. You can use the GitHub for Windows app to add, change and remove code in this space (it's called a "repository"). Not only that, but you can look at your work over time, even on your project's [very own webpage][1]! Super exciting.

Just be sure you're on the branch with your name, not `master`. You can check by looking at the upper left-hand corner of GitHub for Windows, right next to the Sync button.

## Useful commands

`node something.js` will run the contents of `something.js`.
`tessel run something.js` will run the contents of `something.js`, but on the Tessel instead of the computer. Make sure to run this one on the laptop that's actually connected!
`npm install` will pull down all the packages you need for the camp from npm, where people share Node code with each other.
